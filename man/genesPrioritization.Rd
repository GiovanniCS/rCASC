\usage{
genesPrioritization(group = c("sudo", "docker"), scratch.folder, file, nPerm,
  permAtTime, percent, nCluster, separator, logTen = 0, seed = 111,
  sp = 0.8, clusterPermErr = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the scratch folder}

\item{file, }{a character string indicating the path of the file, with file name and extension included}

\item{nPerm, }{number of permutations to be executed}

\item{permAtTime, }{number of permutations computed in parallel}

\item{percent, }{percentage of random cells removed in each permutation}

\item{nCluster, }{the number of clusters, where to run prioritization}

\item{separator, }{separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','}

\item{logTen, }{1 if the count matrix is already in log10, 0 otherwise}

\item{seed, }{important value to reproduce the same results with same input}

\item{sp, }{minimun number of percentage of cells that has to be in common in a cluster, between two permutations, default 0.8}

\item{clusterPermErr, }{probability error in depicting the number of clusters in each permutation, default = 0.05}
}
\value{
VioPlot of silhouette cells value for each number of cluster used,clusterP file with clustering results for each permutation, killedCell file with removed cells in each permutation, clustering.output a sommarize file with general information for each cells.
}
\description{
This function executes a ubuntu docker that produces a specific number of permutation to evaluate clustering and identify the genes that play the major role in clustering.
