\usage{
houseKeep(group = c("sudo", "docker"), scratch.folder, file, separator,
  logTen, geneNameControl = 1, houseK, topCell)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the scratch folder}

\item{file, }{a character string indicating the path of the file, with file name and extension included}

\item{separator, }{separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','}

\item{logTen, }{0 if is raw count, 1 otherwise}

\item{geneNameControl, }{0 if the matrix has gene name without ENSEMBL geneID. 1 if the gene names is formatted as: ENSMUSG00000000001:Gnai3. If the gene names is made only by ensamble name, scannoByGtf has to be run first.}

\item{houseK, }{to be described ....}

\item{topCell, }{to be described ...}

\item{data.folder, }{a character string indicating the folder where input data are located and where output will be written}
}
\value{
return matrix filtered by the best cells that have housekeepin genes most expressed
}
\description{
This function filter your matrix count on a specific gene house keepin list
