\title{Defining with griph the range of  number of clusters to be used with SIMLR}
\usage{
clusterNgriph(group = c("sudo", "docker"), scratch.folder, file, nPerm,
  permAtTime, percent, separator, logTen = 0, seed = 111)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the scratch folder}

\item{file, }{a character string indicating the path of the file, with file name and extension included}

\item{nPerm, }{number of permutations to perform}

\item{permAtTime, }{number of permutations that can be computed in parallel}

\item{percent, }{percentage of randomly selected cells removed in each permutation}

\item{separator, }{separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','}

\item{logTen, }{1 if the count matrix is already in log10, 0 otherwise}

\item{seed, }{important value to reproduce the same results with same input}
}
\value{
A folder Results containing a folder with the name of the experiment, which contains: VioPlot of silhouette cells value for each number of cluster used, a folder with the number of clusters selected as optimal by griph, which contains: clusterP file with clustering results for each permutation, killedCell file with removed cells in each permutation, clustering.output a sommarize file with general information for each cells, hist.pdf describing the number of times a specific number of clusters was used during permutations
}
\description{
This function executes a ubuntu docker that produces a specific number of permutation to evaluate the range of optimal number of clusters using griph algorithm. For more info see rCASC vignette.
