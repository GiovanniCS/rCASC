## Single Cell workflow

- **inDropseq**:
    + Creating a reference genome for inDrop V2:
    + From fastq to UMI counts using inDrop workflow: **indropCounts**
- **Counts manipulation**:
    + Removing non informative genes: **allZeros**
    + Data normalization: **scnorm**
    + Imputing dropouts: **cascImpute**
    + Converting a count table in log10: **counts2log**
- **Cell filtering**:
    + Removing low quality cells: **lorenzFilter**

## inDrop seq

The function indropCounts start for inDrop V2 library and convert fastq to UMI counts.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

indropCounts(group="docker", scratch.folder="/data/scratch", fastq.folder=getwd(),
        index.folder="/data/genomes/mm10indrop", sample.name="C2", split.affixes="S2_L001",
        bowtie.index.prefix="Mus_musculus.GRCm38.85.index", M=10, U=2, D=400, low.complexity.mask="False")

```



## Counts manipulation

### Removing non informative genes

The function **allZeros** removed all genes that are without counts in all cells and plot the frequency distribution of genes with counts in the cells.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
system("gzip -d singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
filterZeros(data.folder=getwd(),counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt")

```


### Data normalization

SCnorm (as detailed in Bacher et al.) performs a quantile-regression based approach for robust normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.  SCnorm groups genes based on their count-depth relationship then applies a quantile regression to each group in order to estimate scaling factors which will remove the effect of sequencing depth from the counts.

#### Check counts-depth relationship

Before normalizing using **scnorm**, it is advised to check the data count-depth relationship. **checkCountDepth** provides a wrapper, in docker4seq, for the checkCountDepth of the [**SCnorm package**](https://github.com/rhondabacher/SCnorm), which estimates the count-depth relationship for all genes.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
system("gzip -d singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
conditions=rep(1,288)
checkCountDepth(group="docker", data.folder=getwd(), counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt", conditions=conditions, outputName="singlecells_counts", nCores=8)

```

The output is a PDF that provides a view of the counts distribution of the data.

#### scnorm

the **scnorm** function execute SCnorm of the [**SCnorm package**](https://github.com/rhondabacher/SCnorm), which normalizes  across  cells  to  remove  the effect  of  sequencing  depth  on  the  counts  and  return  the  normalized expression count.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
system("gzip -d singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
conditions=rep(1,288)
scnorm(group="docker", data.folder=getwd(),counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt", conditions=conditions,outputName="singlecells_counts", nCores=8, filtercellNum=10, PropToUse=0.1)

```

The output is a PDF that provides a view of effects of normalization, and Rda file containing the full output of **SCnorm** and a tab delimited file containing the normalized data.

Setting PropToUse to 0.1 was particularly useful with large UMI based datasets. Proportion of genes closest to the slope mode used for the group fitting. This number affects a lot speed.

### Imputing dropouts

the **cascImpute** function execute scImpute of the [**scImpute package**](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scImpute), which impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
system("gzip -d singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
cascImpute(group="docker", data.folder=getwd(), counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt", drop.thre=0.5, cores=8)

#Modifying drop.thre value A quick version of the imputing can be used to refine drop.thre values indicating refining=TRUE. It has to be done in the same folder where the frst run was done.
cascImpute(group="docker", data.folder=getwd(), counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt", drop.thre=0.3, cores=8, refining=TRUE)
```

The output is a matrix file containing the imputed data. 



### Converting a count table in log10

The function **counts2log** can convert a count table in a log10 values saved in a comma separated file which is the input of CASC.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
system("gzip -d singlecells_counts.txt.gz")
counts2log(counts.matrix="singlecells_counts.txt", data.folder=getwd(), log.base=10, type="txt")
```



## Cell filtering

### Identifying outlier libraries

To identify outlier libraries, [Diaz et al.2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937196/) developed a strategy to estimate genes expressed at background levels in a given sample. Then samples whose background fraction is significantly larger than average is filtered out (Lorenz statistics). Furthermore, this statistics correlates with correlates (Pearson-correlation 0.7) with live-dead staining [Diaz et al.2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937196/).  

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

lorenzFilter(group="docker",scratch.folder="path/of/scratch/folder",
           data.folder="path/of/data/folder",matrixName="matrixName",p_value=0.05,format="txt",separator='\t')

```


### CASC Classification Analysis of Single Cell Sequencing Data

Genome-wide single-cell measurements such as transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular composition as well as functional variation in homogenic/heterogenic cell populations. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same sub-type based on gene expression patterns [Usoskin et al, Pollen et al, Kolodziejczyk et al]. Critical issues in cell clustering are:

- cluster stability

- feature selection, i.e. the identification genes playing the major role in cluster formation. 

To address the above issues, we have developed CASC, a tool implemented in a docker container, that uses as core application to detect cell clusters the “kernel based similarity learning” [Wang et al] and allows: 

- identification of the optimal number of clusters for cell partitioning using “silhouette method”. 

- The evaluation of clusters stability, measuring the permanence of a cell in a cluster upon random removal of subsets of cells. 

-Feature selection via “nearest shrunken centroid method” [Tibshirani et al], applied to the gene Index Of Dispersion [Diaz et al]. 

CASC was tested on previously published data sets [Usoskin et al, Pollen et al, Kolodziejczyk et al]. CASC feature selection procedure efficiently allows the identification of the subpopulation of genes playing the main role in discriminating between cell subpopulations.


#### Introduction

**CASC** is controlled by a set of functions embedded in **kendomaniac/docker4seq** package,
which was developed to facilitate the use of computing demanding applications in the field of NGS data analysis.


This approach provides multiple advantages: 

- user does not need to install all the software on its local server

- results generated by different containers can be organized in pipelines

- reproducible research is guarantee by the possibility of sharing the docker containers used for the analysis 

#### Requirements
The minimal hardware requirements are a 4 core 64 bits linux computer, 32 Gb RAM, one SSD 250GB, with a folder with read/write permission for any users (chmod 777), and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

**IMPORTANT** The first time *docker4seq* is installed the **downloadContainers** needs to be executed  to download to the local repository the containers that are needed for the use of *docker4seq*

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
downloadContainers(group="docker")
```


#### Defining the optimal number of clusters


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/log10_singlecells_counts.csv.gz")
system("gzip -d log10_singlecells_counts.csv.gz")

cascKoptimization(group="docker", scratch.folder="/Users/raffaelecalogero/Desktop/scratch", data.folder=getwd(),
counts.matrix="log10_singlecells_counts.csv", permutations=20, blocks.permutations=2, core=0, bootstrap.fraction=10, k.min=2, k.max=4, totIdentity=80, clusterIdentity=80)

```

The function **cascKoptimization** run SIMLR [Wang et al] using a range of clusters and produces as output two violin plots:

- silhouette.pdf: Silhouette refers to a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data. The technique provides a succinct graphical representation of how well each object lies within its cluster. Here instead of using the average silhouette we represent the silhouette values distribution using a violin plot. Thus, silhouette distributions being skewed to the positive values and with short negative tail is representative of a consistent cluster. In the example below, fig. A, it seems that 4 clusters are the most consistent by silhouette analysis.


- cell.stability.pdf: Cell stability plot represent the distribution of the fraction of times, given a N number of permutations, that the cell are stabily localized in a cluster. The example below, fig. B, 3 clusters are characterized by an higher cell stability with respect to 4 clusters. 

Taking in account the two plots and the clusters structure observed for 3 and 4 clusters, fig C and D, it is clear that 4 clusters provide a better separation between cells but keeping very high the cell permanence in a cluster.

![cluster decision](/Users/raffaelecalogero/Dropbox/data/docker/stable/docker4seq/inst/img/silhouette.stability.jpg)

The function **cascOutputReformat** use SilhouetteParameters.csv (the file containing the cell silhouette scores), mainVector.csv (the file that associates each cell to a specific SIMLR cluster), scoreVector.csv (the file associating each cell to a specific cell stability score), dataPlot.csv (containing SIMLR component 1 and 2 cohordinates) to generate a summary file called **summary_table.csv**.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
 #downloading fastq files
system("wget http://130.192.119.59/public/example.zip")
unzip("example.zip")
setwd("./example")
cascOutputReformat(data.folder=getwd())
```
