## Abstract
**Summary**: Recent technological advances made possible to obtain genome-wide transcriptome data from single cells using high-throughput sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an essential tool to investigate cellular heterogeneity, identifying cell subsets linked to a particular phenotype and highlighting cell sub-population specific signatures. Nowadays, dedicated and user friendly bioinformatics workflows are required to exploit the deconvolution of single-cells transcriptome. Furthermore, there is a growing need of bioinformatics workflows granting both functional, i.e. saving, in terms of meta-data, the information about data and analysis parameters, and computation reproducibility, i.e. storing the real image of the computation environment used to generate and analyze the data. Here, we present rCASC a modular RNAseq analysis workflow, based on docker technology, allowing data analysis from counts generation to cell sub-population signatures identification and granting both functional and computation reproducibility.

## 1 Introduction 
Single cell analysis is instrumental to understand the functional differences existing between cells within a tissue. Individual cells of the same phenotype are commonly viewed as identical functional units of a tissue or organ. However, published single cells sequencing results (Buettner, et al., 2015) suggest the presence of a complex organization of heterogeneous cell states producing together system-level functionalities. Single cell analysis focuses on the understanding differences characterizing any cell within a population of cells. A mandatory element of single cell RNAseq is the availability of dedicated bioinformatics workflows. In the last few years a lot of tools have been developed for the identification of tissue cell subpopulations (Hwang, et al., 2018). However, sub-population identification might require some preprocessing steps of the single-cell sequencing data, depending on the technology in use and on some specific cell characteristics, e.g. cell state. Furthermore, after cell partitioning, extra steps are required to identify cell sub-population signatures, e.g. markers identification. rCASC is a modular workflow, based on docker technology, allowing processing of 10XGenomics, inDrop and whole transcripts single-cell sequences from fastq to the definition of cell sub-population signatures. Furthermore, rCASC addresses the problem of functional and computational reproducibility, which is becoming a very important topic, because of the “Data Reproducibility Crisis” (Allison, et al., 2018).

## 2 Methods
rCASC is developed within the umbrella of the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org), which is an open-source community aiming to develop reproducible bioinformatics workflows. Each module of rCASC is implemented in a docker container, and it is compliant with the rules proposed by Sandve (Sandve, et al., 2013) to guarantee reproducibility. The key elements of rCASC workflow are shown in Fig. 1A, and the main functionalities are summarized below. 

**Data preprocessing**: rCASC allows processing of fastq derived by 10XGenomics and inDrop platforms to generate a cell count matrix annotated using ENSEMBL gene model (Supplementary Section 2). Furthermore, counts matrix, using ENSEMBL gene model, can be processed within rCASC. The most relevant preprocessing modules of rCASC (Supplementary Section 3) allow visualization of the numbers of genes detected in each cell with respect to the cells total reads, removal of low quality cells using Lorenz statistic (Diaz, et al., 2016), removal of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes and the association of gene symbol to the ENSEMBL gene identifier, data normalization (Bacher, et al., 2017), detection of possible cell cycle bias (Liu, et al., 2017) and removal of such effects from the data (Barron and Li, 2016). 

**Cell heterogeneity analysis**: The optimal number of cells partitions is detected inducing perturbations in the structure of the cell data set, i.e. removing a random subset of cells and repeating the clustering. The rational of this approach is that a robust cluster of cells should contain the same set of cells independently by the perturbation of the overall dataset. The bootstrapped dataset is analyzed with a graph-based community detection method (https://github.com/ppapasaikas/griph), allowing the identification of the range of number of clusters observable perturbing the cells dataset structure (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Section 4). Then, the range of number of clusters is probed using SIMLR (Wang, et al., 2017), a clustering framework learning a sample-to-sample similarity measure from expression data. A cell stability score (Supplementary Section 5), indicating the fraction of bootstraps in which a cell is allocated in a specific cluster, is used to identify the optimal number of clusters for the cell sub-populations representation (Fig. 1C). Cells are then plotted in each cluster with a specific symbol indicating its stability (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the shuffling of unstable cells between nearby clusters can be visualized in a video in which each bootstrap is a frame of a video. 

**Clusters specific feature selection**: The identification of clusters specific signatures is addressed with two different methods (Supplementary Section 6).  The ANOVA-like method from edge-R (Robinson, et al., 2010) is used in case of the presence a reference cluster, e.g. in a cells activation experiment it could be the cluster of resting cells undergoing to activation by an external stimulus. In case a reference cluster is not available SIMLR (Wang, et al., 2017) provides a gene prioritization, measuring how gene expression values across cells correlate with the learned cell-to-cell similarity. This information combined with dataset bootstraps allows the identification of genes which are the main players in clusters organization. The genes selected with the above-mentioned approaches can be then visualized with a supervised heatmap ordering cells according to the belonging cluster. 
GUI: rCASC functions are implemented within 4SeqGUI, which makes the analysis user-friendly and suitable for users lacking of scripting knowledge. 


##	Results
The main objective of rCASC is the identification of the most robust partitioning of cell sub-populations within a reproducible framework. The comparison of rCASC with other three single-cell analysis workflows (Supplementary Section 8) indicate that rCASC provides unique features as jackknife resampling for cluster robustness evaluation. The cluster’s robustness, evaluated measuring the persistence of cells in a cluster as consequence of jackknife resampling, provides a better estimation of clusters stability with respect to other measurements as the silhouette plot (Supplementary Section 5, Fig. 23 A,B). With respect to the other workflows, rCASC uses as clustering tool SIMLR, which outer-performed many of the methods implemented in the other workflows.
rCASC modularity structure easily allows the implementation of other pre/post processing methods and supports the implementation of other clustering methods within the resampling framework. Furthermore, rCASC is the only workflow granting functional and computational reproducibility. 


## Conclusion
In conclusion, rCASC is a workflow with valuable new features that could help researchers in defining cells sub-populations and detecting sub-population specific markers, under the umbrella of data reproducibility.
