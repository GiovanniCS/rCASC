## **Section 1** rCASC: a single cell analysis workflow designed to provide data reproducibility

 
Since the end of the 90's omics high-throughput technologies have generated an enormous amount of data, reaching today an exponential growth phase. Analysis of omics big data is a revolutionary means of understanding the molecular basis of disease regulation and susceptibility, and this resource is accessible to the biological/medical community via bioinformatics frameworks. However, because of the fast evolution of computation tools and omics methods, the [*reproducibility crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) is becoming a very important issue [[*Nature, 2018*](https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz)] and there is a mandatory need to guarantee robust and reliable results to the research community [[*Global Engage Blog*](http://www.global-engage.com/life-science/reproducibility-computational-biology/)].

Our group is deeply involved in developing workflows that guarantee both **functional** (i.e. the information about data and the utilized tools are saved in terms of meta-data) and **computation** reproducibility (i.e. the real image of the computation environment used to generate the data is stored). For this reason, we are managing a bioinformatics community called [*reproducible-bioinformatics.org*](http://www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org/) [[*Kulkarni et al.*](https://rdcu.be/9gMq)] designed to provide to the biological community a reproducible bioinformatics ecosystem  [[*Beccuti et al.*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/871/4562334)]. 

rCASC, reproducible Cluster Analysis of Single Cells, is part of the [*reproducible-bioinformatics.org*](http://www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org/) project and provides single cell analysis functionalities within the reproducible rules described by Sandve et al. [[*PLoS Comp Biol. 2013*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)]. rCASC is designed to provide a workflow (Figure below) for cell-subpopulation discovery. 

```{r fig.1, fig.cap="rCASC workflow", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)

include_graphics('../inst/img/fig1.jpg')

```


The workflow allows the direct analysis of fastq files generated with [*10X Genomics platform*](https://www.10xgenomics.com/), [*InDrop technology*](https://1cell-bio.com/) or a count matrix having as column-names cells identifier and as row names ENSEMBL gene annotation. In the following paragraphs the functionalities of rCASC workflow are described.

\pagebreak

### **Section 1.1** Minimal hardware requirements to run rCASC

The RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the dataset under analysis, e.g. up to 2000 cells can be effectively analyzed using the hardware described by Beccuti [[*Bioinformatics2018*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/871/4562334)]: 

- 32 Gb RAM 

- 2.6 GHz Core i7 6700HQ with 8 threads.

- 500 GB SSD

The analysis time can be significantly improved increasing the number of cores.  Implementation of the workflow for computers farm, using [*swarm*](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), is under implementation. 

### **Section 1.2** Installation

The minimal requirements for installation are:

- A workstation/server running 64 bits Linux.

- Docker daemon installed on the machine, for more info see this document:

    + [*https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/*](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

- A scratch folder, e.g. /data/scratch, possibly on a fast I/O SSD disk, writable by everybody:

\fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
chmod 777 /data/scratch
```
\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont

The functions in rCASC package require that user belongs to a *group* with the rights to execute docker.
See the following document for more info:
[*https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/*](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

The following commands allow the rCASC installation in [*R*](https://cran.r-project.org/) environment:

\fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}


install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

### **Section 2.1** inDrop seq

inDrop single-cell sequencing approach was originally published by Klein [[*Cell 2015*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26000487)]. Then, the authors published the detailed protocol in [[*Zilionis et al. Nature Protocols 2017*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27929523)], which has different primer design comparing to the original paper (Figure below). 

```{r fig.2, fig.cap="inDrop library structure", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

### **Section 2.3** Smart-seq full transcript sequencing.

Smart-seq protocol generates a full transcript library for each cell, i.e. a fastq file for each cell. To convert fastq in counts we suggest to use **rnaseqCounts** or **wrapperSalmon** counts from [*docker4seq*](https://github.com/kendomaniac/docker4seq) package [[*Kulkarni et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367595)]. Both above-mentioned functions are compliant with minimal hardware requirements indicated for rCASC and are part, as rCASC, of the [*Reproducible Bioinformatics Project*](http://reproducible-bioinformatics.org/). **rnaseqCounts** is a wrapper executing on each fastq: 

- quality evaluation of fastq with [*FastQC*](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) software, 

- trimming of adapters with [*skewer*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24925680), 

- mapping reads on genome using [*STAR*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104886) and counting isoforms and genes with [*RSEM*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816040). 

**wrapperSalmon** instead implements FastQC and skewer and calculates isoforms and genes counts using [*Salmon*](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon) software.

## **Section 3** Counts matrix manipulation

This paragraph describes a set of functions that can be used to remove low quality cells and non-informative genes from counts tables generated by any single-cell sequencing platform, Figure below}.

- **Counts manipulation**:
    + Plotting detected genes versus total number of UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifier)/reads: **mitoRiboUmi**, **genesUmi**
    + ENSEMBL annotation and genes filtering: **scannobyGtf**
    + Removing low quality cells: **lorenzFilter**
    + Selecting the top X variable/expressed genes: **topx**
    + Removing non informative genes: **filterZeros**
    + Converting a count table in log10: **counts2log**
    + Data normalization: **scnorm**, minimal requirements 10K counts/cell, works best with whole transcript sequencing
    + Data normalization: **umiNorm**, global normalization methods TMM and RLE are suitable for UMI data
    + Removing cell cycle bias: **recatPrediction**/**ccremove**

```{r fig.103, fig.cap="GUI: Counts manipulation menu", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/gui4.png')
```


### **Section 3.1** Removing non informative genes

The function **filterZeros** retains all genes having a user defined fraction of zeros (between 0 and 1, where 1 indicate that only genes without any 0s are retained, and 0 indicates that genes with at least a single value different from zero are retained), and plots the frequency distribution of gene counts in the dataset.

```{r fig.104, fig.cap="GUI: Filter Zeros panel", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/gui5.png')
```



- *Parameters* (only those without default; for the full list of parameters please refer to the function help) (Figure below):
    + *file (GUI Counts table)*,	a character string indicating the path of the tab delimited file of cells un-normalized expression counts
    + *threshold (GUI Threshold)*,	a number from 0 to 1 indicating the fraction of max accepted zeros in each gene. 0 is set as default and it eliminates only genes having no expression in any cell.
    + *sep (GUI Separator)*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','

The output is a PDF providing zeros distributions before and after removal of genes with 0s counts. A tab delimited file with the prefix **filtered\_** in which the filtered data are saved.

**IMPORTANT**: In case user would like to apply cell quality filter, e.g. **lorenzFilter**, it is convenient to remove only genes with 0 counts in all cells, i.e. threshold=0 (Figure below).

### **Section 3.2** Plotting genes numbers versus total UMIs/reads in each cell

To estimate the overall number of genes detectable in each cell, the function **genesUmi** generates a plot of the number of genes present in a cell with respect to the total number of UMI in the same cell. The number of UMIs required to call a gene present in a cell is a parameter defined by the user, the suggested value is 3 UMIs. The function **mitoRiboUmi** plots **genesUmi** output and also generate the percentage of mitochondrial protein genes with respect to percentage of ribosomal protein genes for each cell. 


```{r fig.105, fig.cap="GUI: Genes versus counts panel", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/gui6.png')
```

- *Parameters genesUmi function* (only those without default; for the full list of parameters please refer to the function help):
    + *file (GUI Counts table)*,	a character string indicating the path of the file tab delimited of cells un-normalized expression counts.
    + *umiXgene (UMIs X genes)*,	an integer defining how many UMIs are required to call a gene present. default: 3
    + *sep*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','

- *Parameters mitoRiboUmi* (only those without default; for the full list of parameters please refer to the function help) (Figure below):
    + *file (GUI Counts table)*,	a character string indicating the path of the file tab delimited of cells un-normalized expression counts.
    + *scratch.folder*, 	a character string indicating the path of the scratch folder
    + *umiXgene (UMIs X genes)*,	an integer defining how many UMIs are required to call a gene present. default: 3
    + *separator*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','
    + *gtf.name*, name for the gtf file to be used
    + *bio.type*, ENSEMBL biotype of interest, default "protein_coding"
    
The output are two pdfs named respectively **genes.umi.pdf** (Figure below panel A), where each dot represents a cell. X axis is the total number of UMIs/reads mapped on each cell in log10 format and Y axis is the number of detected genes and **Ribo_mito.pdf** (Figure below panel B), Percentage of mitochondrial protein genes plotted with respect to percentage of ribosomal protein genes. Cells are colored on the basis of total number detected genes. The latter plot is useful to identify stressed cells, i.e. those with high percentage of mitochondrial genes (Figure below panel B, black cells), and low informative cells, i.e. those in which genes are few and mainly ribosomal/mitochondrial (Figure below panel B, black and green cells).

#### **Section 3.2.1** Further considerations about the number of reads/UMIs to be used in a single-cell sequencing experiment.

[*Ziegenhain et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212749) published a comparison between single cell sequencing protocols and they show that, in a simulated experiment, at least 250K reads/cell are required for the detection of at least 80% of differentially expressed genes between two groups (Figure below). Ziegenhain observation clearly also apply to sub-populations clustering. 

```{r fig.6.1, fig.cap="Modified from Figure 6 in Ziegenhain et al. (Mol. Cell 2017). Power of scRNA-Seq methods. For more information on the experiment please see Ziegenhain paper.", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/Ziegenhain2017.jpeg')
```

Sequencing depth, which affects differential expression analysis and sub-population partitioning, influences the structure of a single-cell dataset at two levels: 

- number of genes called present in the experiment,

- robustness of gene expression, i.e. number of reads associated to a gene. 

In particular, the number of genes called present in the experiment is the key element for the discrimination between sub-populations. In Figure below, it is shown the effect of sequencing depth on the number of detectable genes in a set of 10XGenomics sequencing experiments (25K sequenced reads/cell extracted from CD19 B-cells [[*Zheng et al 2016*](https://community.10xgenomics.com/t5/Data-Sharing/10x-Single-Cell-3-Paper-Zheng-et-al-2016-Datasets/td-p/231)],  83K sequenced reads/cell extracted from  naive CD8+ T-cells [[*GSM2833284*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2833284)], and 250K sequenced reads/cell from an unpublished brain mouse experiment) and in an unpublished whole transcript human MAIT-cells  single-cell sequencing done on Fluidigm C1 (25K, 100K, and 250K sequenced reads/cell were subsampled from the original fastqs). 
3 UMIs are used as minimal threshold to call present a gene in 10XGenomics experiments and 5 reads [[*Tarazona et al. 2011*](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/12/2213.long)] as minimal threshold to call a gene present in single cell whole transcriptome experiments.

Figure below clearly shows that the number of genes detectable by 10XGenomics sequencing (Figure below panels A-C) is far less of those detectable using a whole transcript experiment (Figure below panels D-F). In the case of 25K reads/cells in 3' end sequencing (Figure below panel A) the number of called genes goes from a dozen of genes to 350. In a whole transcript sequencing experiment where 25K reads/cells were considered (Figure below panel D), 350 genes is the lowest number of genes detectable in a cell. In 10XGenomics experiment with 250K reads/cell the range of detectable genes goes from few hundred to 2000, which is relatively similar to the number of detectable genes in a whole transcripts experiment  where the same number of reads/cells were considered. 
The larger scattering and the overall lower number of detectable genes in 3' end sequencing experiment, with respect to whole transcript experiments, is a peculiarity of the technology [[*Ziegenhain et al. 2017*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212749)].  
It has also to be highlighted that cells with a very low number of genes called present will have a genes repertoire made mainly of housekeeping genes, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, see Figure below in **Section 3.4**. Thus, the lack of cell-type specific genes makes these cells useless for the identification of functional cell sub-populations.


However, it has to be underlined that each cell type is characterized by a peculiar transcriptional rate and therefore, the technical assessment of the reads per cell vs. genes detected between different cell types, i.e. Figure below panels A-C, might be bias by differences in the transcriptional rate of the different cells used in this specific example. Instead, the above-mentioned bias does not affect, Figure below panels D-F, because they are generated by a down sampling of a set of cells sequenced with the smart-seq protocol at a coverage of 1 million reads/cell. 

```{r fig.6.2, fig.cap="Number of detected genes with respect to mapped reads. A) 25K reads/cell 10XGenomics platform, 3\' end sequencing v2 chemistry.

```

The above observations indicate that 3' end sequencing has a much lower genes called present with respect to whole transcript sequencing.

We have further investigated the following point:

- Is the number of total UMIs/cell affecting the separation between sub-populations?

To address the above point, we used two types of cells belonging to the T-cells [[*Zheng* 2016](https://community.10xgenomics.com/t5/Data-Sharing/10x-Single-Cell-3-Paper-Zheng-et-al-2016-Datasets/td-p/231)]. The two sets of cells were sequenced with a coverage of approximately 21K reads/cell: 

- T-cytotoxic (10209 cells, Figure below panel A) cells, 

- T-regulatory (10263, Figure below panel B) cells. 

We generated three datasets:

- **d3.4**, which is made of 100 cells randomly selected within cells having, in each of the two datasets, a total UMIs/cell value greater than 2511 in each cell.

- **d3**, which is made of 100 cells randomly selected within cells having, in each of the two datasets, a total UMIs/cell value comprised between 2511 and 1000 in each cell.

- **d3m**, which is made of 100 cells randomly selected within cells having, in each of the two datasets, a total UMIs/cell smaller than 1000 in each cell.

The separation between T-cytotoxic and T-regulatory achievable with PCA is shown in Figure below panels C-E.

It is notable that only the dataset including cells with more than 2511 UMIs/cell (Figure below panel E) is the one where the separation between the two T-cell types improves. In the d3 and d3m (Figure below panels C,D) the amount of variance explained by the first component is much lower of that observable in d3.4 and the datasets are intersperse. 

Thus, since 3' end sequencing platforms (10Xgenomics, inDrop) has the advantage to produce high number of sequenced cells, users might decide to select for clustering only the subset of cells with the highest number of genes called present. 

### **Section 3.3** Identifying and removing cell low-quality outliers

Lorenz statistics was implemented in rCASC **lorenzFilter** function. This function derives from the work of Diaz and coworkers [[*2016*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937196/)] detecting low quality cells and this statistics correlates with live-dead staining [[*Diaz et al. 2016*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937196/)]. 

```{r fig.106, fig.cap="GUI: Lorenz Filter panel", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}

The output are a file with prefix **annotated_**, containing all annotated genes and a file with prefix **filtered_annotated_** which contain the filtered subset of cells. Furthermore, the **filteredStatistics.txt** indicates how many cells and genes were removed.

Ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins represent a significant part of cell cargo. Large cells and actively proliferating cells will have respectively more ribosomes and more active ribosome synthesis [[*Montanaro et al. 2008*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18583314)]. Thus, ribosomal proteins expression might represent one of the major confounding factor in cluster formation between active and quiescent cells. Furthermore, the main function of mitochondria is to produce energy through aerobic respiration. The number of cell mitochondria depends on its metabolic demands [[*Nasrallah and Horvath 2014*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200564)]. This might also affect clustering, favoring the separation between metabolic active and resting cells, with respect to functional differences between sub-populations.
*scannobyGtf* allows also the removal of mitochondrial and ribosomal protein genes.

### **Section 3.5** Top expressed genes

For clustering purposes user might decide to use the top expressed/variable genes. The function **topx** provides two options:

- the selection of the X top expressed genes given a user defined threshold, parameter type="expression"

- the selection of the X top variable genes given a user defined threshold, parameter type="variance"

    + gene variance is calculated using edgeR Tag-wise dispersion. The method estimates the gene-wise dispersion implementing a conditional maximum likelihood procedure. For more information please refer to edgeR Bioconductor package manual.

The function also produces a pdf file gene_expression_distribution.pdf showing the changes in the UMIs/gene expression distribution upon **topx** filtering.

### **Section 3.6** Data normalization

[*The best way to normalize single-cell RNA-seq data has not yet been resolved*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549838/), especially in the case of UMI data. We inserted in our workflow two possible options:

- [*SCnorm*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473255/), which works best with whole transcript data.

- [*scone*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/16/235382), which provides different global scaling methods that can be applied to UMI single-cell data.

#### **Section 3.6.1** SCnorm

[*SCnorm*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473255/) performs a quantile-regression based approach for robust normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.  SCnorm groups genes based on their count-depth relationship then applies a quantile regression to each group in order to estimate scaling factors which will remove the effect of sequencing depth from the counts.

IMPORTANT: SCnorm is not intended for datasets with more than ~80% zero counts, because of lack of algorithm convergence in these situations. 

##### **Section 3.6.1.1** Check counts-depth relationship

Before normalizing using **scnorm**, it is advised to check the data count-depth relationship.
If all genes have a similar relationship then a global normalization strategy such as median-by-ratio in the DESeq package or TMM in edgeR will also be adequate. However, when the count-depth relationship varies among genes global scaling strategies leads to poor normalization. In these cases, the normalization provided by SCnorm is recommended.

```{r fig.109, fig.cap="GUI: SCnorm: check counts-depth relationship panel", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/gui10.png')
```

**checkCountDepth** provides a wrapper, in rCASC, for the checkCountDepth of the [*SCnorm package*](https://github.com/rhondabacher/SCnorm), which estimates the count-depth relationship for all genes.

- *Parameters* (only those without default; for the full list of parameters please refer to the function help) (Figure below):
    + *file (GUI Counts table)*,	full path to the file MUST be included. Only tab delimited files are supported
    + *conditions*,	vector of condition labels, this should correspond to the columns of the un-normalized expression matrix. If not provided data is assumed to come from same condition/batch.
    + *ditherCounts (GUI UMI)*,	boolean. Setting to TRUE might improve results with UMI data.
    + *FilterCellProportion (GUI Min non-zero cells)*, a value indicating the proportion of non-zero expression estimates required to include the genes into the evaluation. Default is .10, and will not go below a proportion which uses less than 10 total cells/samples
    + *FilterExpression (GUI Med non-zero expr. threshold)*, a value indicating exclude genes having median of non-zero expression below this threshold from count-depth plots

scone package embeds:

- Centered log-ratio (**CLR**) normalization 

- Relative log-expression (**RLE**; DESeq) scaling normalization

    + the scaling factors are calculated for each lane as median of the ratio, for each gene, of its read count of its geometric mean across all lanes. 

- Full-quantile normalization

    + quantile normalization is a technique for making two or more distributions identical in statistical properties. To quantile normalize two or more samples to each other, sort the samples, then set to the average (usually, arithmetic mean) of the samples. So the highest value in all cases becomes the mean of the highest values, the second highest value becomes the mean of the second highest values, and so on.

- Simple deconvolution normalization 

- Sum scaling normalization

    + Gene counts are divided by the total number of mapped reads (or library size) associated with their lane and multiplied by the mean total count across all the samples of the dataset.

- Weighted trimmed mean of M-values (**TMM**, edgeR) scaling normalization (suitable for single-cell)

    + to compute the TMM factor, one lane is considered a reference sample and the others test samples, with TMM being the weighted mean of log ratios between test and reference, after excluding the most expressed genes and the genes with the largest log ratios. 

- Upper-quartile (**UQ**) scaling normalization

    + the total counts are replaced by the upper quartile of counts different from 0 in the computation of the normalization factors.

**IMPORTANT**: In case sub-population discovery is the analysis task, it is important to check if a specific normalization is compliant with the clustering approach in use. For example, in the case of [*SIMLR*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960), the rCASC core clustering tool, the normalizations provided in **scone** are not compliant, because they remove some of the features required to run the SIMLR multi-kernel learning analysis. TMM is instead compliant with the rCASC implementation of [**tSne**](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). In case [*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) clustering is used the dataset does not required any normalization since a normalization procedure is included in the algorithm.

### **Section 3.8** Detecting and removing cell cycle bias

Single-cell RNA-Sequencing measurement of expression often suffers from large systematic bias. A major source of this bias is cell cycle, which introduces large within-cell-type heterogeneity that can obscure the differences in expression between cell types. [*Barron and Li*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33892) developed in 2016 a R package called [*ccRemover*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ccRemover/index.html) which removes cell cycle effects and preserves other biological signals of interest.

However, before applying *ccRemover*, it is essential to address if the removal of cell cycle effect is required. [*reCAT*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00039-z) is a modeling framework for unsynchronized single-cell transcriptome data that can reconstruct cell cycle time-series.  Thus, reCAT cell cycle prediction step can be used to check if  cell cycle effect can be detected in a dataset and therefore ccRemover normalization approach will be needed.


#### **Section 3.8.1 ** Evaluating the presence of cell cycle effect in a dataset: [*reCAT*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00039-z)

```{r fig.113, fig.cap="GUI: cell cycle estimation panel", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/gui14.png')
```


**reCAT** prediction step is implemented in rCASC in the function **recatPrediction**, which requires a data set annotated using **scannobyGtf**.

- *Parameters* (only those without default; for the full list of parameters please refer to the function help) (Figure below):
    + *scratch.folder*,	the path of the scratch folder
    + *file (GUI Counts table)*,	the path to the input file
    + *separator*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','
    + *geneNameControl (GUI gene name format)*,	0 if the matrix has gene symbol without ENSEMBL code. 1 if the gene names is formatted like this : ENSMUSG00000000001:Gnai3. If the gene names is only ENSEMBL name SCannoByGtf has to be executed before recatPrediction.
    + *seed*,	important parameter for reproduce the same result with the same input, default 111
    + *window (GUI N. cells/point)*, number of cell plotted per point

To show the differences existing between a dataset characterized by cell cycle bias and one that is not, we used two datasets:

- the dataset published by [[*Buettner et al. 2015*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599176)], containing naive-T-cells and T-helper2-cells mixed together and sorted on the basis of the cell cycle state. 

- The quiescent naive T-cells dataset part of the publication of [*Pace et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29326266), expected to be in G0. 

To execute the analysis on the same number of cells, 288 cells were randomly selected from quiescent naive T-cells dataset. In Figure below panel A the presence of oscillatory behavior is evident in the predicted cells time series and the G1 and G2M trends are indicated respectively in blue and red dashed curves. On the other hand, the oscillatory behavior is totally absent (Figure below panel B) in the naive T-cells, which are expected to be quiescent in G0.

The analyses above were done using a [SeqBox](www.seqbox.com), equipped with an Intel i7-6770HQ (8 threads), 32 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD. They took  in total 54 and 40 mins for recatPrediction respectively on Buettner and the naive T-cells datasets. 28 mins were needed by ccRemove on Buettner data set. ccRemover analysis produces a ready-for-clustering data normalized matrix. The matrix can be identified by the prefix **LS_cc_**.
**ccRemove** output is compliant with [*SIMLR*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960), the rCASC core clustering tool. **ccRemove** output does NOT require log transformation when applied to SIMLR.

The rCASC core clustering tool is [*SIMLR*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960), which requires as input the number of clusters to be used to aggregate cell sub-populations. Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to the definition of the most probable number of clusters, in which cells will aggregate. Some of the possible ways to identify the most probable number of clusters is summarised in: [*"Determining the optimal number of clusters: 3 must known methods - Unsupervised Machine Learning"*](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/print.php?id=239).

Another important aspect is how the number of detectable clusters might change if the number of cells changes in the dataset, e.g. upon removal of a random subset of cells. Because single-cell experiment, at least today, are rarely characterized by biological replications and frequently they represent the initial step of an analysis aimed at the identification for new cell sub-populations, it is very important to assess the stability of cells aggregations detected by clustering methods.

### **Section 4.1** Estimating the number of cluster to be used for cell sub-population discovery by community detection method.

In rCASC, the identification of the optimal number of clusters is addressed, in presence of cells number perturbations, with [*griph*](https://ppapasaikas.github.io/griph/). The clustering performed by griph is graph-based and uses the community detection method  [*Louvain modularity*](http://igraph.org/r/doc/cluster_louvain.html). Griph algorithm is closer to agglomerative clustering methods, since every node is initially assigned to its own community and communities are subsequently built by iterative merging. Griph is embedded **clusterNgriph** function, which evaluates the number of clusters in which a set of cells will aggregate upon a user defined leave-N\%-out cells bootstraps. In the example below the number of clusters are detected for the file 'annotated_buettner_G1G2MS_counts_10000bis.txt', used in **Section 3.8**.

In Figure below it is shown the output generated by **clusterNgriph**. The output folder is called **Results** and it is located in the folder from which the analysis started. Within Results is present a folder named as the dataset used for the analysis. In this case 'annotated_buettner_G1G2MS_counts_10000bis'. In the latter folder is present a folder, in this specific example '5', named with the number of clusters that were more represented as result of the bootstrap analysis. The file indicated with the blue arrow contains all the information to generate the griph output plot, used as reference to allocate cells to a specific cluster at each bootstrap step. The file indicated with the green arrow contains the cluster position for each cell over all bootstrap steps. The file indicated with the red arrow contains the cells removed at  each bootstrap step. The file called 'hist.pdf', indicated with the black arrow, is the plot of the frequency of different number of clusters generated by griph as consequence of the bootstrap steps. In this specific case, over 160 permutations, 80 produced 5 clusters, 70 produced 4 clusters and 10 produced 6 clusters.

```

It has to be noted that in principle, since this dataset has a strong cell cycle effect, we would have expected ideally only three clusters: G1, S and G2M. This toy experiment clearly shows that perturbation of the dataset under analysis can affect the number of detectable clusters. Thus, to identify the clustering condition which guarantees the greatest cell stability in a cluster, in our opinion it is mandatory clustering cells taking in account perturbation effects. In Section 4.2 we further investigate this issue. 

#### **Section 4.2** K-mean clustering: Investigating how cell sub-populations aggregation is affected by dataset perturbations.

As indicated above we are interested to identify not only the optimal cluster number but also if the cluster number is affected by removal of a random subset of cells. 
To observe the effect of datasets perturbation in clustering we built 4 datasets combining different cell types available in [*Zheng* 2016](https://community.10xgenomics.com/t5/Data-Sharing/10x-Single-Cell-3-Paper-Zheng-et-al-2016-Datasets/td-p/231) paper (Bold cell types are those that were progressively substituted in setA):

- setA 100 cells randomly selected for each cell type:
    + (B) B-cells (25K reads/cell), (M) Monocytes  (100K reads/cell), (S) Stem cells (24.7K reads/cell), (NK) Natural Killer cells (29K reads/cell),  (N) Naive T-cells (19K reads/cell)

- setB 100 cells randomly selected for each cell type:
    + (B) B-cells, (M) Monocytes, (H) **T-helper cells** (21K reads/cell), (NK) Natural Killer, (N) Naive T-cells
    
- setC 100 cells randomly selected for each cell type:
    + (C) **Cytotoxic T-cells** (28.6K reads/cell), (M) Monocytes, **T-helper cells**, (NK) Natural Killer,  (N) Naive T-cells
    
- setD 100 cells randomly selected for each cell type:
    + (C) **Cytotoxic T-cells**, (NC) **Naive cytotoxic T-cells** (20K reads/cell), (H) **T-helper cells**, (NK) Natural Killer, (N) Naive T-cells

Moving from SetA to setD we added progressively cells coming from T-cell populations, making the cell-type partitioning more challenging because of the similarities between T-cell sub-populations.
    
We used PCA (Figure below panels A-D) to visualize the dissimilarity between cells populations. PCA measures the variance between the elements of the dataset and the most important differences in variance are estimated by the PC1.

PC1 shows that, as the differences between cell populations become smaller, moving from setA to setD, the aggregation in homogeneous groups of cells is compromised (Figure below panels A-D).  

To observe the effect of the reduced dissimilarity between populations on the stability of the number of clusters, we use the rCASC **clusterNgriph** function on the above mentioned 4 datasets using 160 permutations/each, and randomly removing in each permutation 10\% of the cells. Each analysis took approximately 60 mins on a SeqBox hardware.

It is notable that as the differences between the cells populations is narrowing (i.e in setA cells types are quite different in overall functional activity, as in setD four out of five cell types are T-cells sub-populations) the fluctuations in the detected number of clusters increase. In setA, where PCA is able to discriminate between the five cell populations (Figure below panel A), out of 160 bootstraps only 1 gave a number of clusters different from the effective number of cell sub-populations (Figure below panel A). In all the other three subsets perturbations result in a higher number of events in which number of clusters differs from 5 (Figure below panels B-D). 

```{r fig.16, fig.cap="Clusters number is dependent by the cell type similarity: A) number of clusters detectable by griph in setA, B) number of clusters detectable by griph in setB, C) number of clusters detectable by griph in setC, D) number of clusters detectable by griph in setD", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('../inst/img/griph2.png')
```

As highlighted in **Section 3.2.1**, the difficulties in detecting a stable number of clusters, upon dataset perturbations, is due to the limited number of detected genes. To further support this hypothesis, we run a comparison between the most expressed genes in the cell types used in the above example.

Figure below  shows the number of identical genes found in common between naive T-cells and the other sub-populations in setA and setD, using lists of increasing size and ordered by expression level. The plot shows that naive T-cytotoxic, T-cytoxic and T-helper, from setD, share with naive T-cells, within the top 500 most expressed genes, more genes with respect to the other cell types present in setA. Thus, the lack of cell-type specific genes between 4 out 5 cell types in SetD dataset negatively affect the stability dataset partitioning, upon bootstraps.

The results described in this section indicate that **clusterNgriph** is a valuable instrument to define a range of numbers of clusters to be further investigated with supervised clustering approaches.


## **Section 5** K-mean clustering: detecting cell sub-populations by mean of kernel based similarity learning ([*SIMLR*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960)).

The number of clustering and dimension reduction methods for single cell progressively increased over the last few years. Last year [*Wang and coworkers*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960) published SIMLR, a framework which learns a similarity measure from single-cell RNA-seq data in order to perform dimensions reduction. We decided to select this method as core clustering tool in rCASC, because outperformed eight methods published before 2017 [[*Wang and coworkers*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960)].


Specifically, we use SIMLR as clustering method recording the effects of data perturbation, i.e. removal of random subset of cells, on the clustering structure. Although, we think SIMLR provides important advantages with respect to other clustering methods, rCASC framework can embed also other data reduction tools. At the present time, tSne is also implemented within the rCASC data permutation framework.

One of the peculiarities of rCASC is the user tunable bootstrap procedure. rCASC represents bootstrap results via a cell stability score (Figure below). In brief, a set of cells to be organized in clusters  (Figure below panel A) is analyzed with SIMLR, applying a user defined k number of clusters (Figure below panel B). A user defined \% of cells is removed from the original data set and these cells are clustered again (Figure below panel C). The clusters obtained in each bootstrap step are compared with the clusters generated on the full dataset using Jaccard index (Figure below panel D-E). If the Jaccard index is greater of a user defined threshold, e.g. 0.8, the cluster is called confirmed in the bootstrap step (Figure below panel F). Then to each cell, belonging to the confirmed cluster, *cell stability score* value is increased of 1 unit (Figure below panel G). At the end of the bootstrap procedure, cells are labeled with different symbols describing their *cell stability score* in a specific cluster (Figure below panel H).

The output of **simlrBootstrap** function is described in Figure below. The output is localized in the *Results* folder (Figure below Folder 1), which is created in the folder where the analysis started. This folder contains the count matrices used in the analyses. In this example the count matrices are those belonging to setA and B (see Section 4.1). In the *Results* folder  are also present folders labeled with the name of the count matrix used in the analysis (Figure below Folder 2, annotated\_bmsnkn\_5x100cells, annotated\_bmHnkn\_5x100cells). In each of these folders there are a set of folders indicated with a number that refers to the analyzed range of number of clusters (Figure below Folder 3). In this specific example  the range of clusters goes from 4 to 6. In each *NameOfCountMatrix* folder there is a file called **\_Stability\_Violin\_Plot.pdf** (Figure below panel A) which represents the distribution of the cells stability scores over the bootstraps in the range of number of clusters investigated. Figure below panel A clearly show that the analysis done with k=5 is the one providing the highest stability of cells within each cluster. The other plot that is also available in the folder (Figure below Folders 4) is **NameOfCountMatrix\_vioplot.pdf**, Figure below panel B, which contains the distribution of the [*Silhouette*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) values for each cluster over the bootstraps. [*Silhouette*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) value is a measure of computation cluster stability, and evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Clearly the information provided by Silhouette plot is much less informative for the definition of the optimal clustering number with respect to the information provided by the cells stability score (Figure below blue arrow). In each clustering folder there is a pdf named *NameOfCountMatrix_Stability_Plot.pdf*, which contains two plots (Figure below panels C-D) generated by the clustering program. These plots provide a 2D view of the clustering results from two different perspectives. In Figure below panel C plot each cell is colored on the basis of the belonging cluster and it is labeled with a symbol indicating its cell stability score (CSS). Instead, in the plot in Figure below panel D each cell is colored on the basis of its CSS: 0-25\% black, 25-50\% green, 50-75\% gold and 75-100\% red. 
Here, we show the plots generated with k=6 to better describe the information described in the above-mentioned clusters plots, as in k=5 clusters all cells have a CSS greater than 75\%. In Figures below panel C and D it is shown that 4 out of 6 clusters cells remain in a cluster between 75 to 100\% of the bootstraps (+ symbol in Figure below panel C and red dots in Figure below panel D). The plot, Figure below panel E, shows the genes detectable in each cell in function of the total number of reads/cell. In this plot cells are colored with the same color of their belonging cluster. This plot is useful to observe if the clustering is biased by the number of genes called in each cluster. In this specific example, only the green cluster is characterized by a number of detected genes, which is larger of those detectable in the other clusters (Figure below panel E). This is expected, since blue cluster is made of Monocytes, which have been sequenced to 100K reads/cells, as all other cells in setA were sequenced between 19 to 29K reads/cell, see **Section 4.2**.

 In Figure below are shown the effects, on cell stability, in SIMLR analysis done with 4 and 6 clusters for SetA (*annotated_bmsnkn_5x100cells.txt*) counts matrix. Using 4 as number of clusters, Figure below panel A, some of the cells in each cluster show a reduced stability (50-75\%, triangle) and arrows highlights cells characterized by a cell stability score between 25 to 50\%. The circles in Figure below panel B show the clusters where the full cluster has a cell stability between 50 to 75\%. This observation indicates that the stability score is a useful measure to identify the optimal number of partitions to be used, i.e. the highest cell stability score  was observed when five clusters were selected, corresponding to the number of cell types combined in SetA, see **Section 4.2**.

The effect of the perturbations induced in the clustering upon the removal of 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% of the data set was also investigated in SetA (*annotated_bmsnkn_5x100cells.txt*), Figure below.

```


```{r fig.21a, fig.cap="Cell stability score for SIMLR analysis with k=5 clusters removing progressively 10 (A), 20 (B), 30 (C) and  50 (D) percent of the cells at each permutation.", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}

```

Increasing the fraction of cells removed at each permutation affects, in a negative way, the overall cell stability score of each cell in each cluster. However, the reduction in CSS is not identical for all clusters. In Figure above, it is clear that cluster 2, completely made of NK cells, is the most stable cluster to the perturbations induced by increasing the number of removed cells. On the other side, cluster 4, mainly made by stem cells (92 cells), together with few B-cells (2 cells) and Monocytes (7 cells) is the least stable. Sorting by increasing CSS the cells in cluster 4, Figure above panel D, all B-cells and Monocytes are found within the first 15 most unstable cells. This observation suggests that studying CSS, increasing the fraction of cells removed at each permutation, could highlight the presence of cells located at the boundaries of different clusters. In this specific example, clusters 1, which is mainly composed of B-cells and few stem cells (2 cells), and cluster 3, which is fully made of Monocytes, could represent the exchange clusters for the most unstable cells detected in cluster 4.


```{r fig.21b, fig.cap="Investigating cell stability score relation with clusters cells heterogeneity. SIMLR analysis was performed on both datasets using 160 permutations and k=5.

We investigated clusters composition of two sets of cells described in section 4.2: SetA and SetC. 
SetA is made of cell types with different biological characteristics, i.e. (B) B-cells, (M) Monocytes, (S) Stem cells, (NK) Natural Killer cells, (N) Naive T-cells. 
SetC contains Monocytes, Natural Killer cells and with T-cells subpopulations, i.e. (C) Cytotoxic T-cells, (H) T-helper cells and Naive T-cells, Figure above. CSS provides indications on clusters cells heterogeneity. In Figure above panel A and C, clusters characterized by high cell stability score are mainly constituted by one cell type. On the other hand, as CSS decrease, Figure above panel B and D, clusters become characterized by an increasing heterogeneity in the cell types composition. E.g. In Figure above panel B and D, cluster 5 (violet) has a CSS between 75% to 100% and it is made only by monocytes, cluster 2 (light green), which has a CSS between 50% and 75%, has a 11% contamination of T-helper cells. Cluster 3 (green), which has a CSS between 25 to 50%, is contaminated by 12% Cytotoxic T-cells and 4% T-helper cells. Finally, clusters 1 and 4, characterized by CSS between 0% to 25%, are very heterogeneous incorporating 4 out of 5 cell types present in this dataset.


### **Section 5.2** Visualizing the cell clusters relocation during bootstraps.

The function **permutationMovie** allows the generation of a video showing the relocation of cells at each bootstrap. In this example we use the results shown in Figure above panel B, where circles show the clusters where all cells have a cell stability between 50 to 75\%.

The video was generated in 8 minutes on SeqBox hardware. The video is saved in the cluster folder used for the analysis and it has the name **outputname.mp4**. The video generated with the above script is accessible [*here*](https://youtu.be/ZBP9W-WU-WQ).

In Figure below panel A is shown a screenshot of the output of **bootstrapsVideo**. The output of this function provides extra information with respect to the standard output of the **simlrBootstrap** and **tsneBootstrap**, since the video provides an overview of the area (colored circles) in which the cells of a specific cluster are localized as consequence of the bootstraps. This visualization provides a better description of the maximum size of the clusters and simplify the identification of clusters that are more near to each other, because of clusters structure, Figure below panel A. In this specific example, is notable that, even if the yellow cluster has a high cell stability score, Figure below panel B, its size is much greater of that observable for all the other clusters, because few cells with lower cell stability score (50-75\%, triangle) are located very near to the blue cluster, arrow in Figure below panel B.

### **Section 5.3** Estimating cluster stability.

[*Hennig*](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/148823/) published an elegant paper entitled Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability. The [*R package fpc*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fpc/index.html) is associated to the paper. In this package, Jaccard index is used to evaluate the similarity between clusters. The calculated score (cluster stability measurement, CSM) is intended to provide an overall quality score for each of the clusters in toto. In particular, the clusterboot function allows to evaluate the cluster stability using a personalized clustering function. We have implemented this function to estimate CSM of the clusters generated with SIMLR, Seurat and tSne.

## **Section 6** Clustering (autonomously detecting the number of clusters required for data partitioning): [*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html), [*griph*](https://github.com/ppapasaikas/griph) and [*scanpy*](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) graph-based clustering.

[*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html), [*griph*](https://github.com/ppapasaikas/griph) and [*scanpy*](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) use similar clustering approaches. However, time required for clustering, in the rCASC framework, is quite different as the number of cell increases, see (Fig. 7 in main manuscript).

### **Section 6.1**: [*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)

Recently [*Freytag et al.*](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1297/v1) and [*Do et al.*](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1141/v2) described, in their independent comparison papers, that [*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) delivered the overall best performance in cells clustering. Thus, we decided to include in our workflow also this clustering tool. Seurat clusters cells based on their PCA scores, with each PC essentially representing a âmetageneâ that combines information across a correlated gene set. 
The bootstrap approach described in **section 5.1** is also applied to Seurat clustering to assign cell stability score to the clustered cells.
The first step of the analysis is the identification of the how many PCs have to be to included.


**seuratPCAEval** function allows the exploration of PCs to determine relevant sources of heterogeneity and to define the range of PCs to be used.

### **Section 6.4** Comparing SIMLR, tSne, Seurat, griph and scanpy clustering.

In Wang [[*2017*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263960)] article it is demonstrated that SIMLR outperforms other data reduction methods. [*Freytag et al.*](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1297/v1) and [*Do et al.*](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1141/v2) described that [*Seurat*](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) delivers the overall best performance in cells clustering. 
Here, we run a comparison between SIMLR, tSne, Seurat, griph and scanpy within the rCASC bootstrap framework to observe how cells stability score is affected by the three clustering methods.
The bootstrap approach described in section 5.1 is also applied to tSne, Seurat, griph and scanpy clustering to assign cell stability score to the clustered cells. 
In rCASC tSne is implemented using the [*Rtsne*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rtsne/index.html) package. Rtsne performs a data reduction on which k-mean clustering is applied.
tSne is embedded in **tsneBootstrap** function within the rCASC bootstrap framework.

    + *clusterPermErr*,	probability error in depicting the number of clusters in each permutation, default = 0.05
    + *perplexity*,	number of close neighbors for each point. This parameter is specific for tSne. Default value is 10. the performance of t-SNE is fairly robust under different settings of the perplexity. The most appropriate value depends on the density of your data. A larger/denser dataset requires a larger perplexity. Typical values for the perplexity range between 5 and 50.

We run the analysis on the SetA described in Section 4.1. SIMLR Seurat and griph detect the 5 clusters, i.e. 5 cell types, and all clusters show an high CSC (Figure below panels A-C). However, tSne detects the 5 clusters, but they are less stable in terms of CSS (Figure below panel E). For scanpy we tested various combination of perplexity and PCs number but we failed to find a condition detecting the 5 clusters and clusters stability is very poor.
From the point of view of the computation time, the above mentioned analysis took 159 mins for tSne, 168 mins for SIMLR, 194 mins for Seurat, 61 mins for griph and only 9 minus for scanpy.

## **Section 7** Detecting the genes playing the major role in clusters formation

Nowadays there are a lot of methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes between two populations of single-cell experiments [[*Soneson et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481549)]. However, the number of tools applicable to single-cells and allowing something similar to an ANOVA  are very few. An ANOVA-like approach is described as applicable to single-cells in [*edgeR Bioconductor package*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910308). The edgeR ANOVA-like requires a comparison with respect to a reference set of cells. SIMLR and Seurat also provide ranking score for the genes, which are affecting mostly the clusters organization. SIMLR and Seurat gene ranking do not require a reference cluster for the analysis, thus providing wider applications with respect to ANOVA-like.
The three methods are part of the rCASC framework.

    + *sep*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','
    + *cluster.file*,	a character string indicating the _clustering.output.txt file of interest, generated by bootstrapSimlar or bootStrapTsne. IMPORTANT this file must be located in the same folder where counts.table is placed
    + *ref.cluster*,	a number indicating the cluster to be used a reference for anova-like comparison with the other clusters.
    + *logFC.threshold*,	minimal logFC present in at least one of the comparisons with respect to reference covariate
    + *FDR.threshold*,	minimal FDR present in at least one of the comparisons with respect to reference covariate
    + *logCPM.threshold*,	minimal average abundance
    + *plot*,	boolean, TRUE a plot of differentially expressed genes is generated

The input file is a counts table, which is modified by **anovaLike** adding the cluster number to cell name with an underscore. It is mandatory that no other underscores are located in the table. Then, counts table is reorganized to locate at the beginning of the table the set of cells belonging to the cluster used as reference group. The differentially expressed genes statistics for all genes are saved in the file with prefix **DE\_**, followed by the counts table name. The filtered differentially expressed genes statistics, including only genes detected as differentially expressed in at least one of the clusters is saved with prefix **filtered\_DE\_** followed by the counts table name. **logFC\_filtered\_DE\_** refers to the file containing only logFC extracted from **filtered_DE_** file. The count table is also saved reordered on the basis of cluster positions and has the extension **\_reordered.txt**

    + *fileLogFC*,	a character string indicating the absolute path to logFC_filtered_DE_ file generated by anovaLike function
    + *fileCounts*,	a character string indicating the absolute path to reordered counts table file generated by anovaLike function
    + *delta*,	the minimal distance between the max value of FC for a gene in a cluster of interest and the nearest other max FC in any of the other clusters. This value defines the minimal distance with respect to the same gene in another cluster to identify it as a cluster specific gene.
    + *sep*,	separator used in count file, e.g. '\\t', ','

This function focus only on upregulated genes because the ANOVA-like procedure compares all clusters with respect to a reference cluster. Thus, up-regulated genes are genes specific of the cluster under analysis as those down-regulated are characteristics of the reference cluster. The delta parameter describes the minimal distance existing, for a specific gene average logFC in a specific cluster, with respect to all the other clusters under analysis. The outputs of the function are four tab delimited files:

- the file with prefix **onlyUP\_**, followed by the counts table name, i.e. the count table only containing the selected genes,

- the file with prefix**onlyUP\_**, followed by **logFC_filtered_DE_**,  the table containing logFC only for the selected genes, 
- the file **onlyUP_clusters_specific_genes.txt**, which contains the list of specific genes associated with the corresponding cluster.

- the file **onlyUP_clusters_specific_genesSYMBOLs.txt**, which contains the list of specific genes SYMBOLS from onlyUP_clusters_specific_genes.txt. This file is used by function **hfc** to generate features specific heatmap.

### **Section 7.2** A machine learning approach: SIMLR genes prioritization

SIMLR gene prioritization approach relies on the output similarity and does not depend on the downstream dimension reduction or clustering. The advantage of this step is that one can identify highly fluctuating genes that are consistent with the learned similarity in the multiple-kernel space.

The function **genesPrioritization** executes SIMLR gene prioritization within the rCASC bootstrap framework.

## **Section 9** An example of rCASC analysis: [*GEO:GSE106264*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106264).

[Pace et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326266) explored the role of histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 in murine CD8+ T cells activated after Listeria monocytogenes infection.  They showed that Suv39h1 controls the expression of a set of stem cell-related memory genes and its silencing increases long-term memory reprogramming capacity. The single-cell sequencing data from the [*Pace's Science  paper*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326266):

- naive CD8+ T lymphocytes, here named **N** 

- CD8+ T cells activated after Listeria monocytogenes infection, here named **NA**

- naive Suv39h1-defective CD8+ T lymphocytes, here named **Nd**

- Suv39h1-defective CD8+ T cells activated after Listeria monocytogenes infection, here named **NdA**



### **Section 9.1** Selecting subsets of cells with the highest number of called genes.

On the basis of our observation in **Section 3.2.1**, we selected, for each of the above mentioned groups, the cells with higher number of total reads/cell. Specifically, we analyzed 600 cells, combining respectively 50 cells from **N** and **Nd** and 250 cells for **NA** and **NdA**.  The rational of the different number of cells for the naive and the activated is due to the expectation that activated cells will be organize in multiple clusters and naive are expected to be homogeneous. Cell labels in the counts table were modified adding the groups *N*, *Nd*, *NA* and *NdA*.

Using this dataset, we tried to address the following questions: 

1. Does Suv39h1 silence gene expression program in naive CD8+ T cells?

2. Does Suv39h1 silence gene expression program in activated CD8+ T cells?

3. Does Suv39h1 silencing affect the differentiation of new subsets of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes?


With the script below we have performed the following steps:

- annotating the counts table with **scannobyGtf** function, 

- removing the ribosomal and mitochondrial genes with **scannobyGtf** function, 

- selecting the most expressed 10K genes for the analysis with **topx** function,

- detecting the range of interesting number of clusters to be used for data partitioning (6-9) with **clusterNgriph**

- identifying 6 as the optimal number of clusters and evaluated the cell stability in each cluster with **simlrBootstrap**

- generating the video of the bootstrap analysis with **bootstrapsVideo**

In Figure above, they are summarized the results of the analysis executed on the Pace's dataset. A limitation of the clustering based on SIMLR is due to the need of providing as input the number of clusters (k) in which the data should be organized. Instead of asking to user to define arbitrarily the k number of clusters, we used [*griph*](https://github.com/ppapasaikas/griph) as tool to identify a range of k clusters to be inspected by SIMLR. Figure above panel A shows the frequency of k number of clusters, in which the Paceâs dataset can be organized using griph software, upon 160 bootstraps in which 10% of the cells is randomly removed from the initial data set. Griph analysis identify a range of clusters going from k=6 to k=9. K=7 is the most represented data organization detected by griph, followed by 8, 6 and 9 clusters.
The range of k clusters detected using griph is then investigated with SIMLR. SIMLR is run for each k of the k-range defined with griph tool. CSS violin plot (Figure above panel B) shows that the mean stability for k=6 ($\overline{CSS}$ ~ 0.5) is higher than the others ks ($\overline{CSS}$ < 0.3). Clusters k=7 and k=8 do not represent the most stable organizations in terms of CSS (Figure above panel B), although they are the most frequent organizations observed in griph analysis (Figure above panel A). Since the best $\overline{CSS}$ is observed in k=6, we explored these clusters (Figure above panel C). In Figure above panel C clusters 1, 3 and 4 show a quite good stability, since cells stay in these clusters between 75 to 100\% of the bootstraps. 
The inspection of Paceâs experiment groups organization (i.e. **N**= naÃ¯ve WT, **Nd**= naÃ¯ve Suv39h1 KO, **NA**=activated WT, **NdA**=activated Suv39h1 KO) in k=6 clusters, Figure above panel C,  show that cluster number 4 is the only one containing only NdA (33\% of the total NdA) cells. Thus, suggesting that a subpopulation of activated Suv39h1-silenced cells has a specific transcription profile, which differentiates them from all wild type activated cells. Another interesting cluster is number 6, where the amount of NA and NdA is unbalance, 35\% NA and 13.6\% of NdA, suggesting that Suv39h1 silencing does not guarantee at the same efficiency the differentiation of this cell subpopulation as in the case of wild type cells. Cluster 5 is the most heterogeneous cluster. It is composed by 6 N cells, 2 Nd cells, 34 NA cells, 21 NdA cells. Despite the presence of a limited number of naive cells, which might be explained as partially activated, cluster 5 is composed by an unbalance number of activated cells, i.e. 13.6\% NA and 8.4\% NdA of total cells. However, since cluster 5 is characterized by a very low CSS (0-25\%) it is possible that this cluster contains cells localized at the boundaries of clusters 2, 3 and 6. On the other side clusters 1, 2, 3 have nearly the same number of wild type and Suv39h1 silenced cells, suggesting that these subsets of cells are not influenced by Suv39h1 silencing: 

- cluster 1 contains nearly the same amount of activated wild type, 16 NA (6.4\%), and Suv39h1 KO cells, 14 NdA (5.6\%);

- cluster 2 is made of 44.8\% of NA and 39.6\% of NdA cells;

- cluster 3 is made of 44 N (88\%) and 48 Nd (96\%).

**NB** \% always refers to the total number of cells used in this example (50 N, 50 Nd, 250 NA, 250 NdA); [*annotated_setPace_10000_clustering.output.txt*](http://130.192.119.59/public/annotated_setPace_10000_clustering.output.txt), contains all information required to reproduce clusters shown in Figure above panel C. 
In Figure above panel D it is shown permutation 55 of the output of **bootstrapsVideo**, which can be seen [*here*](https://youtu.be/w5Jj8QxKXRU). This permutation is representative of the majority of the observed permutations. From **bootstrapsVideo** analysis is clear that cluster 5 is strongly affecting the cell score stability of clusters 6 and 2, and for less extent that of cluster 3. 

This analysis can provide some preliminary answers to the questions raised above:

1. Does Suv39h1 silence gene expression programs in naive CD8+ T cells?

    a. No, naive cells cluster together independently from Suv39h1 silencing.

2. Does Suv39h1 silence gene expression programs in activated CD8+ T cells?

    a. Yes, cluster 4 is only made of an activated Suv39h1 KO sub-population. Furthermore, although quite unstable, cluster 6 sub-population is less represented in activated Suv39h1 silenced cells, suggesting a reduction in efficiency in the differentiation of this sub-population upon Suv39h1 silencing.
    
3. Does Suv39h1 silencing affect the differentiation of new subsets of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes?

    a.  Yes, cluster 4 represents a unique Suv39h1 subset of activated CD8+ T cells.
    




### **Section 9.2** Improving clustering results

On the basis of Figure above panel D and the output of [*bootstrapsVideo*](https://youtu.be/w5Jj8QxKXRU) clearly cells in cluster 5 represent a strong interference for an efficient clustering. Thus, we investigated  if, removing cluster 5 cells (Figure above panel C), cell stability score for cluster 6 and 2 could be improved.

The results of the analysis done removing cells associated to cluster 5 are shown in Figure below. The range of clusters suggested by **clusterNgriph** are between 5 and 9, Figure below panel A. The best cells stability score is observable for 5 clusters, Figure below panel B. **simlrBootstrap** results show a large improvement of the overall stability of the clusters Figure below panel C with respect to the previous analysis, Figure below panel C. It is also notable that the samples organization with in clusters agrees with preliminary answers in Section 5.1.1 .

### **Section 9.3** Detecting the genes playing the major role in clusters generation: EdgeR ANOVA-like analysis

We detected a total of 2742 differentially expressed genes using the naive cluster 3 as reference in an ANOVA-like analysis, see **Section 6.1**.

The following analysis focus only on up-regulated genes, i.e. those gene specifically more expressed in a cluster with respect to the naive cluster used as reference in the ANOVA-like.

\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont


We analyzed the results coming out of the **clustersFeatures** selection focusing on the two clusters that are different in cell ratio between wt and Suv39h1-defective T-cells: cluster 1, showing a 2.4:1 ratio between wt and Suv39h1-defective T-cells,  and 2, only detected in Suv39h1-defective T-cells, Figure above panel C. 31 genes were detected as specific for cluster 1. [*EnrichR*](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) analysis indicated the over-representation of STAT3 in ENCODE and ChEA Consensus TFs from ChIP-X datasets and TNFRSF13B, CCL5, CCL4 and CXCR6 in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction dataset. On the basis of the above observations and on a PUBMED search ([*Ccl5*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16982880), [*STAT3*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23830147), [*Ccl9*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27883012) and [*Cxcr6*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28855310)), we suggest that cluster 1 is made of early activated precursors having some traits of memory cells. This cluster is also characterized by an unbalance ratio between activated wt T-cells and Suv39h1-defective T-cells.

The cluster 2 has some traits of memory cells, on the basis of EnrichR analysis of 100 genes. Enrichment analysis shows enrichment for STAT3 transcription specific paths and GO Biological process enrichment for **response to cytokine**. Furthermore,  a PUBMED search showed the presence in this cluster of memory specific genes such as [*TCF7*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28973925), [*FOXO1*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28973925), [*Bach2*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335726), [*Ccr7*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000950), [*Id3*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335726), [*Il7r*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567129), [*Myc*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16449532), [*Pdk1*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28137869), [*Socs3*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22118528), [*Tnfsf8*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177108), 


The analysis of cluster 2 was extended using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). This sub-population of cells, only detectable within Suv39h1-defective T-cells, is enriched for immuno-related functions: Development of hematopoietic progenitor cells, Adhesion of lymphocytes, Quantity of T-lymphocytes, systemic autoimmune syndrome. A subset of cluster 2 genes can be also aggregated in a network characterized by various transcription factors (Figure below). Interestingly, in this network are present Id3, Bach2 IL7R and Myc. Combining the information that Bach2 is associated to the generation ([*Roychoudhuri et al. 2016*](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.bibliopass.unito.it/pubmed/27158840)) of long-lived memory cells and Id3  to their maintenance ([*Yang et al. 2011*](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.bibliopass.unito.it/pubmed/22057289)) together with the knowledge that IL7R/Myc expression is found to be associated to a longer persistence of mouse memory T-cell ([*Pace et al. 2018*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29326266)) it could be suggested that cells belonging to this cluster are precursors of long-lived memory cells.

```


The paper [*Pace*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326266) showed that Suv39h1-defective CD8+ T cells show sustained survival and increased long-term memory reprogramming capacity. Our reanalysis with rCASC extends the information provided from the single cell analysis in Pace paper, suggesting the presence of an enriched Suv39h1-defective memory subset, cluster 2 in Figure above panel C. Noteworthy, this example suggests that even few hundreds cells are sufficient to discriminate between sub-populations.


## **Section 10** Tips and tricks

In this section we highlight some points that might help data analysis.


### **Section 10.1** Data preprocessing

Lorenz statistics (*lorenzeFilter* function) was designed using C1 - Fluidigm and smart-seq libraries. There are no evidences that it performes optimally on UMI based sequencing. In case of UMI, we suggest the use of  *topx* and *filterZeros* functions, which respectively allow the selection of a user defined set of genes with high dispersion/expression and the removal of genes with a user defined fraction of 0s.


Unless there is a specific interest on mitochondrial and ribosomal protein genes, we suggest to remove them before performing clustering (*scannobyGtf*, function). Specifically ribosomal genes represent a high fraction of the UMI counts associated to a cell and might result in driving the cells partioning.

The normalization for sequencing depth (*checkCountDepth* and *scnorm* functions) was designed for smart-seq single cell sequencing data. This normalization can be applied  to UMI sequencing data but it requires at least 10K UMIs/cell.

Cell cycle estimation (*recatPrediction* function) and removal (*ccRemove** function) were designed for smart-seq single cell sequencing data. In our hands they are also working on UMI seqencing data althought, if the cell number exceed few thousands, cell cycle estimation became very slow. We suggest to perform cell cycle estimation on a random subset of few hundreds cells (*subSetCell* function) of the data set under analysis.


### **Section 10.2** Clustering


As part of the output of the clustering procedure there is a plot of the number of detected genes as function of the number of cell UMIs. In this plot, each cell is colored on the basis of the cluster it belongs. This plot helps in understanding if cell clusters simply correlate with number of genes called in each cell. Ideally, there should not be any correlation between clusters and number of genes detected in a cell, since clustering should be driven by cells' biological content and not by the number of detected genes.


On the basis of our tests SIMLR and Seurat generated results comparable in terms of CSS and clusters homogeneity. Since griph and scanpy results correlate less with SIMLR and Seurat, we suggest to use them only if a very large set of cells has to be analysed, e.g. >20K cells.
