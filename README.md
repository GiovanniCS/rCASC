# rCASC
Since the end of the 90's omics high-throughput technologies have generated an enormous amount of data, reaching today an exponential growth phase. Analysis of omics big data is a revolutionary means of understanding the molecular basis of disease regulation and susceptibility, and this resource is accessible to the biological/medical community via bioinformatics frameworks. However, because of the fast evolution of computation tools and omics methods, the [*reproducibility crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) is becoming a very important issue [[*Nature, 6 July 2018*](https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz)] and there is a mandatory need to to guarantee robust and reliable results to the research community [[*Global Engage Blog*](http://www.global-engage.com/life-science/reproducibility-computational-biology/)].

Our group is deeply involved in developing workflows that guarantee both **functional** (i.e. the information about data and the utilized tools are saved in terms of meta-data) and **computation** reproducibility (i.e. the real image of the computation environment used to generate the data is stored). For this reason we have founded a bioinformatics community called [*reproducible-bioinformatics.org*](http://www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org/) [*Kulkarni et al. BMC Bioinformatics*](https://rdcu.be/9gMq) designed to provide to the biological community a reproducible bioinformatics ecosystem  [[*Beccuti et al. Bioinformatics 2018*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/871/4562334)]. 

rCASC, Cluster Analysis of Single Cells, is part of the [*reproducible-bioinformatics.org*](http://www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org/) project and provides single cell analysis functionalities within the reproducible rules described by Sandve et al. [[*PLoS Comp Biol. 2013*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)]. rCASC is designed to provide a complete workflow (Figure 1) for cell-subpopulation discovery.

## Installation

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("kendomaniac/rCASC", ref="master")
```

## Requirements

You need to have docker installed on your linux machine, for more info see this document: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/. 

The functions in rCASC package require that user is sudo or part of a docker group. See the following document for more info: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#/manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

IMPORTANT The first time casc is installed the downloadContainers needs to be executed to download to the local repository the containers that are needed for the use of docker4seq

```
library(rCASC)
downloadContainers()
```

**IMPORTANT** In case you are running rCASC in a virtual linux machine is important to assign to the machine at least 8 Gb RAM
